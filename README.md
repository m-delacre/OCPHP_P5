## OCPHP_P5

Hi ðŸ«¡!

This is a project from my Openclassrooms education.

The goal here is to make a personal blog where I can share articles, visitors can register and leave comments.

There is also an administration part available.

For this project you will need:

A web server, a relational database server, PHP

Personally I have used :

Wampserver: 3.3.0;
Apache: 2.4.54.2;
PHP: 8.0.26;
MySQL: 8.0.31;
PhpMyAdmin: 5.2.0;


ðŸ¦ž
